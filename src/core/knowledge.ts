// Portable capability knowledge: what one installation learned about software, exported without
// credentials or anyone's data, and accepted elsewhere only after the receiving runtime has
// revalidated it against its own environment and authority.
//
// Exported: program identity (name, version, SHA-256, OS, architecture), learned capabilities
// (contracts, invocation templates, behaviour fingerprints), evidence claims, and conformance
// examples made of the investigator's SYNTHETIC inputs. Published goals built on them go without
// their fixed values.
// Never exported: credentials, caller inputs or outputs, run records, receipts, fixed goal values.
