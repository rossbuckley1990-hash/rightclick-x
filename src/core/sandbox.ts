// a fresh temporary directory that is deleted afterwards, no reads under user home directories
// except that directory, a scrubbed environment, and limits on wall time, CPU time, file size,
// open files and output. Memory/process count use a sampled watchdog, NOT a hard kernel bound:
// short peaks and non-resident/compressed memory may escape observation. Every run is its own process group, and the whole
// group is terminated when the program exits or exceeds a limit, so nothing it started outlives it.
// Where the OS offers no such sandbox, execution is refused ("unavailable"), never run unconfined.
//
// The operator may widen this by declaration (RCX_SANDBOX_READ / _READ_DENY / _WRITE / _PATH /
// _NET / _TIMEOUT_MS / _MEMORY_MB / _FILE_MB), never the agent and never a capability. Everything
// is deny-by-default and every widening is restated in `enforces`, so a capability card cannot
// claim more confinement than the run it describes actually had. Declaring a read root also grants
// stat — not listing, not contents — on the directories above it, because a root that cannot be
// path-resolved is unusable: see resolutionAncestors. A read-deny root may be declared
// before it exists, so a barrier can precede the data it conceals: see pendingDenyRoot.
